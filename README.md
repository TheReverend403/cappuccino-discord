## Developers
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used for formatting and PEP 8 compliance checks.

These checks must pass in order to make a commit to `master`. To install and use the hooks, run the following commands:

```shell script
poetry shell # If you're not already in the poetry env.
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files # or just make a commit to run checks automatically.
```
